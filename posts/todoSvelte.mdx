Let me start by saying that Svelte documentation is AMAZING!

<br />

A TODO app is farily simple to build. It does not make use of complex concept of the tool you are using to build it. <a href=''>In this post</a> you can find a more extensive explanation of how the app works.

<br />

That said, you still need to learn how to share data between components by passing props, calling methods, etc.

I manage to build the whole app by just following [the examples on Svelte documentation page](https://svelte.dev/examples). Amazing!

<br />

One thing that you immediatly notice when you start working with Svelte is that how small the boilerplate code is. You can just create a file with `.svelte` and start writing html.
How cool is that?

To add Javascript (and make use of Svelte features) you just need to add a `<script>` tag and you are good to go.

Same with styles: just add a `<style>` tag and start writing css.

<br />

I would not want learn Svelte as my first Javascript framework tho. Svelte does a lot of things under the hood that you might not understand if it is your first framwork you learn.

Example: In React you use `export default MyComponent` to export a component. In Svelte you dont need that.

As soon as your create a file with `.svelte` extension, the Svelte compiler exports it automatically.

If Svelte was your first framework you might not even ask yourself this question.

<br />

Passing a prop to a component is "interesting" in a weird way in Svelte.

<br />

Say you have a variable called `hello` that you want to pass down to a child component:

<br />

  <div>
  {{let a = x}}
  </div>

```js
  <script>
    import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.svelte';
    const hello = 'hello';
  </script>

  < ChildComponent hello={hello} />}
```

<br />

In the child component then you need to use, brace yourself, the `export` keyword to accept the prop:

<br />

```js
// ChildComponent.svelte

  <script>
    export let hello;
  </script>

  <span>{hello} there</span>
```

<br />

WAT? :D Anywaysss...

<br />

State in Svelte is a piece of cake. At least the variation of it with no stores involved.

You just declare a variable in the script tag and use it wherever you want in the file. The component will get rerendered when that variable changes.

Nice stuff!

<br />

Overall I really like Svelte. I hope I will get the chance to create something more complex with it. You should try it too! :)
