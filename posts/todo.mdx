Hey, today I had this inspiration: I am going to build a TODO app with all the main JS frameworks/libraries that I want to learn.
This will allow me to get to know the basics of that specific tool.

I will start with Svelte. In the future will build a TODO app with React, Vue, Solid, Remix and other tools I want to get to know better.

<br />

The TODO app will be simple (I am trying hard to not overcomplicate it with 'features'
:D) but functional. It will be a crud type app: so the app will allow you to create
a todo, read it, update it and delete it.

<br />

It will then save the todos to `localstorage` so they are persistent between sessions.

<br />

I will make the source code available also! Stay tuned!
