...eventually.

<br />

Today happened something that reminded me of [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law). The only thing that could have gone wrong, actually went wrong.
Now a lof of effort is needed to fix it what could have been a half an hour work a year ago.

<br />

Say today you notice something that can cause problems in the future. Right now it hardly causes an inconvenience, but eventually, at some point, most probably, it will cause a problem.

Do you fix it now, by spending time and inconveniencing yourself on something that causes no problem at the moment? Or you leave it as is, and risk it causes a big problem in the future that you will need
10x the effort to fix it?
